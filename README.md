# Webtops
Webtop are desktops in your browser, that help you navigate the web.
Custom [Widgets](#Widgets) allow you to gather all the information you want in one place and
quickly navigate them with shortcuts and it's custom [CLI](#CLI).
[Check it out](https://liamvdv.github.io)!

## Quick-StartðŸš€
Switch between the three possible Webtops with shortcuts.
```
ALT + SHIFT
ALT + DIGIT
```

Activat the CLI by typing > into the searchbar.

Search [Amazon](https://amazon.com/) for kitchen magnets with ascending prices with the **amz** command:
```
> amz kitchen magnets -s asc
```
Search [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for a question with **so**:
```
> so check if a str is numeric
```

```
> help <command>
```
